# hackmit-hackify
Hackify your Facebook profile picture!

## Development
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will watch and build changes to js files with Babel, as well as serve static files at `localhost:8080`.

If you simply want to test out Hackify locally, `npm run start` will just run `http-server`.
